This app is currently being used by GBH on the New Jersey Nightly News Collection. The app has only been evaluated in terms of precision. On a small set of videos (<100) the tool had 100% precision when detecting bars in the first minute of a video. So far, for GBH it has made the most sense to only detect the first instance of bars in a video because they plan to use the metadata to start a video after the first bars have ended. This reduces the dataset that we've tested on to the first 5 minutes or till the end of the first bars, whichever is first, for the test set.
